# Plant_leaf_disease_prediction
## Using CNN
This project aims to develop a method for detecting plant diseases using CNNs by analyzing leaf images.The CNNs are proficient in handling large datasets and can dynamically learn new features from them in a supervised manner. By learning the important features from the input images, CNNs can make accurate predictions about the presence of diseases in plant leaves.
